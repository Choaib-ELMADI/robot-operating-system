=> ROS2 Package:
    * It can be considered as a container\organizer for your ros code.
    * Packages are designed to be modular, reusable, and shareable.

=> ROS2 Workspace:
    * A ROS2 workspace is a directory where you can develop, build, and install multiple ROS2 packages.

=> ROS2 Executable:
    > Refers to the compiled binary or script that can be run.
    -> An executable can contain one or more nodes.
    --> The executable itself is just a file that you run.

=> ROS2 Node:
    > Refers to the functional entity that performs specific tasks.
    -> Each node represents a part of the functionality provided by the executable.
    --> The node defines how the software is structured in terms of communication and computation.

=> ROS2 Topics:
    * ROS2 topics are a way for different nodes to talk to each other by sending and receiving messages.
    * Publisher: publishing node, a sensor node that publishes some data to a topic.
    * Subscriber: subscribing node, a processing node that subscribes to a topic to receive data from it.

=> ROS2 Interfaces:
    * An interface refers to the messages, services, and actions that nodes use to communicate.

=> ROS2 Actions:
    * Actions are a way to define and handle tasks that take some time to complete and might need feedback along the way.
    * Actions are designed for tasks that take a while to finish.
    * Actions can provide feedback during execution.
    * Actions consist of goal, feedback, and result:
        >> Goal: A request to perform a task.
        >> Feedback: Periodic updates about the progress of the task.
        >> Result: The final outcome of the task once it is completed.

    -> Action Server: The entity that executes the task and provides feedback and results.
    -> Action Client: The entity that sends the goal to the action server and can receive feedback and results.
